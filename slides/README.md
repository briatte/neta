# Legislative Cosponsorship Networks in the French Parliament

This talk explains how to analyze the networks formed by legislative cosponsorship in the French Parliament, by going through

1. a technical section, on how to scrape cosponsorship data into network form (Fowler 2006),
2. a methodological section, on how to estimate weighted network measures from the data (Opsahl et al. 2010), and
3. an empirical section on party polarization in the French National Assembly since 1986.

The methods covered by this talk have applications to other legislatures, and the associated code provides functions that can be applied to other parliamentary sources.

This proposal is a follow-up to Baptiste Coulmont's talk at the previous conference, and to my own lightning talk. I can turn my proposal into a lightning talk if needed.
