    This paper measures the extent of party polarization in the French Parliament politics through the ebb and flow of legislative collaboration between its members. Drawing extensively on existing studies of cosponsorship networks in the U.S. Congress, we introduce similar data for both legislative chambers over the past seven legislatures. We then use exponential graph models to measure the influence of party affiliation on the likelihood of cosponsorship since 1986. Like roll-call spatial voting models of French legislative politics, our results tend to reveal a primarily one-dimensional policy space structured by left-right politics and strong party loyalty.%
